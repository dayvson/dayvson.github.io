    <h2>Games:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/dayvson/talele">Talele</a> is an iOS jigsaw puzzle game. It allows players to select pictures from their photo library in order to create an infinite number of jigsaw puzzles. Once a picture is selected the user chooses from three levels: Easy (12 pieces), Normal (24 pieces), and Hard (48 pieces).I was inspired to create Talele by my 4 year old son, who said he wanted to play a jigsaw puzzle with family pictures. The name itself is the name of his imaginary friend.

    <h2>Physical Computing:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/dayvson/wellnessmirror">Wellness Mirror</a> is a mirror that reads a person’s quantified self data (physical activities, sleep hours, weight…) from Fitbit and translates the data into different colors and patterns of light that illuminates users in front of the mirror. In this way, users can see a person’s vigor and vitality through the reflection of themselves altered by the data. Built in partnership with <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/~msd403/blog/?p=1301">Maria Paula Saba</a>
